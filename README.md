Documentation: https://lennes.github.io/spect/


Please note:
This is the updated repository where the scripts are subject to change! The collection is currently on its way towards release 2.0.0...

In case you were looking for an older version of one of the scripts, or, if you wish to cite, e.g., the "SpeCT 1.0.0" release (whose contents used to be available at http://www.helsinki.fi/~lennes/praat-scripts), check out the archived release and citation instructions at https://github.com/lennes/spect/releases/tag/1.0.0.
